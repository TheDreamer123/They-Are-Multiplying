# They Are Multiplying!
**This mod simply makes zombies (any type, including zombified piglins and zoglins), slimes and phantoms breedable.**

## How do I breed them?
**Simple! Just do what you would do with sheep or pigs!**

## What items can I use to breed?
**All breeding items can be changed via datapacks, here's the defaults!**

**Drowned: Any type of vanilla fish, any type of raw vanilla meat, rotten flesh and spider eyes.**

**Husk: Any type of raw vanilla meat, rotten flesh and spider eyes.**

**Magma cube: See the next point.**

**Phantom: Phantom membranes.**

**Slime: See the next point.**

**Zoglin: Same as drowned.**

**Zombie: Same as Husk.**

**Zombie Villager: Same as Husk.**

**Zombified Piglin: Same as Husk.**

## What about slimes and magma cubes?
**They can eat anything, in their case, the tag is used to blacklist an item of being used to breed them.**

## How do I work with the tags on a datapack?
**The mod automatically links a tag to the corresponding mob.**

**If you want to change items used to breed the vanilla mobs this mod changes create the file in the following path:**

`theyaremultiplying/tags/items/minecraft/mob_name_edible.json`

**If you want to change the Zombified Piglin the path would look like this:** `theyaremultiplying/tags/items/minecraft/zombified_piglin_edible.json`

**In the case of slimes and magma cubes, replace "edible" with "inedible"**

## Compatibility with other mods?
**Yes, this mod should be compatible with any mod that adds an entity extending one of the vanilla entities this mod changes.**

**If you wish to add a tag to a modded entity use this path:**

**Let's pretend the mob was added by the mod with a namespace of "mobsplus" and the entity is called "burnt_zombie"**

**The path for this one would be:** `theyaremultiplying/tags/items/mobsplus/burnt_zombie_edible.json`
